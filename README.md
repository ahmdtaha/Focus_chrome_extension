# Focus_chrome_extension
A Chrome extension that blocks social media links during a certain schedule, e.g, Weekday 8-5. Inspired by [Focus](https://heyfocus.com/), I decided to make a free version with simpler options. The current version is not user friendly, but is straight forward for someone with basic computer skills.

## How to use it

* Download and extract this repos :)
* [Install the chrome extension manually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmXJOWeecvc). Basically, (1) enable the developer mode, (2) load unpacked extension
* Update [config.js](https://github.com/ahmdtaha/Focus_chrome_extension/blob/master/config.js) to match your preference


## Config Format

Before explaining the config file format, it is important to know that everytime you change this file (add/remove new preference), you need to refresh the extension by clicking ths reload button as shown in the next figure.
